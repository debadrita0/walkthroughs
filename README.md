#walkthrough

These are the walkthroughs that we had to build in MuleSoft Training course- Level 1. this project includes:
- Training American Flights- Building An American Flight API in Design Center of Anypoint Platform and then publishing it through Exchange  and again importing it to the Anypoint Studio and directly deploying it to the cloudhub.

- I have used here process records: which basically includes different connectors like Batch-job, For-each, Scatter-Gather as well getting their output using the debugger and PostMan API

- lastly, i have contributed a self assessment API, which I have designed as well as deployed. -Accounts.api
